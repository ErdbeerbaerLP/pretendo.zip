# Pretendo.zip

Pretendo.zip is an simple website to get your console up and running with Pretendo.

## Why?
Because I was bored and thought this would be useful to some.
This website also eliminates the need to re-host potentially outdated packages, as it always fetches up-to-date files (at least for most Wii U files).


## Deployment
Just upload to a webserver and navigate to it.
Potentially needs a few adjustments to php.ini to allow handling files and downloads.
